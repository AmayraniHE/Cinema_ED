# Cinema Java

## Description

This project is a Cinema System developed in Java that utilizes data structures for efficient management of cinema operations. The system has both front-end and back-end components. The front-end is built using Java Swing for a graphical user interface, while the back-end handles data processing and storage.

## Features

- Manage movie listings, schedules, and bookings
- User-friendly GUI for interacting with the cinema system
- Efficient data handling using custom data structures
- Separate front-end and back-end components

## Usage
